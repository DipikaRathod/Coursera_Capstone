    "New York is famous for its Italian-American cuisines. In this project, We will try to determine the optimal location in the neighborhood of **New York City** to setup a new **Italian Restaurant** .\n",

    "New York already has lot of places which are famous for differnt kinds of Italian foods.Thus our focus will be on **finding a location which is not yet much crowded with Italian Restaurants**. Since, we are also particularly interested in setting up an Italian restaurant, we will be looking at **areas with no Italian restaurants in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n",

    "We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."

    "Second step in our analysis will be calculation and exploration of '**restaurant density**' across different areas of Berlin - we will use **heatmaps** to identify a few promising areas close to center with low number of restaurants in general (*and* no Italian restaurants in vicinity) and focus our attention on those areas.\n",

    "In third and final step we will focus on most promising areas and within those create **clusters of locations that meet some basic requirements** established in discussion with stakeholders: we will take into consideration locations with **no more than two restaurants in radius of 250 meters**, and we want locations **without Italian restaurants in radius of 400 meters**. We will present map of all such locations but also create clusters (using **k-means clustering**) of those locations to identify general zones / neighborhoods / addresses which should be a starting point for final 'street level' exploration and search for optimal venue location by stakeholders."
